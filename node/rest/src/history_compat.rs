//! History compatibility mode (`--history-compat-mode`).
//!
//! A note on the comments in this module and in its handlers in `routes.rs`: they are deliberately
//! far heavier than elsewhere in snarkOS, and they record rationale and the literal requests and
//! responses observed from the upstream API, against the usual guideline. This is a temporary
//! shim that proxies and rewrites another service's responses, it was written under time pressure,
//! and getting it right depends on facts about that service that are not visible in the code --
//! so the facts are written down next to the code that relies on them.
//!
//! # What this is, and why it exists
//!
//! snarkOS used to have a `history` cargo feature that recorded every mapping update in RocksDB
//! and served "the value of mapping `m` at key `k` as of block `h`" from that record, along with a
//! `history-staking-rewards` feature that recorded each block's staking rewards. Those tables were
//! unsound -- they never recorded deletions, so a key removed at height `h` was still served at
//! its last value for every height above `h`, and they mixed two incompatible height encodings --
//! and both features were removed (snarkVM #3418 and #3408 describe the defects).
//!
//! Some operators had exposed those routes to their own customers, and this mode keeps the routes
//! up for them: the node registers the same paths and produces the same response bodies, but the
//! data comes from the Provable historical staking API, which is backed by a fork of snarkOS that
//! writes a *full* JSON snapshot of each `credits.aleo` staking mapping at every block. Because a
//! snapshot is complete, a key that is absent from it was not in the mapping at that height,
//! which is exactly the case the tables got wrong. This mode is a temporary shim until a proper
//! archival mode exists; expect it to be removed then.
//!
//! # The upstream API
//!
//! One endpoint, `GET {base_url}/{network}/block/{height}/history/{name}`, where `name` is one of
//! `bonded`, `delegated`, `metadata`, `unbonding`, `withdraw` or `stakingrewards`. The five
//! mapping snapshots are a JSON array of `[key, value]` pairs, both Aleo plaintext strings exactly
//! as `Plaintext::to_string` / `Value::to_string` render them (so the node can hand them back
//! verbatim). Observed on mainnet:
//!
//! ```text
//! GET https://mainnet.historical-staking.provable.com/mainnet/block/1000000/history/unbonding
//! -> 200
//! [
//!   [
//!     "aleo1qgtvgvzkxqyh0jc7wxv3zjzjcd5epll38uv4wmmxjt8hexjluygqu4ukl2",
//!     "{\n  microcredits: 31712836548u64,\n  height: 883089u32\n}"
//!   ],
//!   ...
//! ]
//!
//! GET https://mainnet.historical-staking.provable.com/mainnet/block/1000000/history/bonded
//! -> 200
//! [
//!   [
//!     "aleo1qy4qufq03wcph05fdf5aj09ez67vcmmlrzqf0zza352qwaq43gyqt3wdf6",
//!     "{\n  validator: aleo1vfukg8ky2mhfprw63s0k0hl4vvd8573s6fkn8cv9y0ca6q27eq8qwdnxls,\n  microcredits: 141347021440u64\n}"
//!   ],
//!   ...
//! ]
//!
//! GET https://mainnet.historical-staking.provable.com/mainnet/block/1000000/history/metadata
//! -> 200

//!   ["aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc", "16u32"],
//!   ["aleo1qgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqanmpl0", "138u32"]
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! `stakingrewards` is shaped differently: a JSON object keyed by staker address, whose value is
//! `[validator address, reward in microcredits]` for the reward paid at that block:
//!
//! ```text
//! GET https://mainnet.historical-staking.provable.com/mainnet/block/1000000/history/stakingrewards
//! -> 200
//! {
//!   "aleo1qy4qufq03wcph05fdf5aj09ez67vcmmlrzqf0zza352qwaq43gyqt3wdf6": [
//!     "aleo1vfukg8ky2mhfprw63s0k0hl4vvd8573s6fkn8cv9y0ca6q27eq8qwdnxls",
//!     6477
//!   ],
//!   ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A block the upstream has no snapshot of is **not** a 404: the upstream's file read fails and
//! it answers 500 with a plain-text body naming the missing file. Observed for block 0 (before its
//! recording started) and for a height far above the tip:
//!
//! ```text
//! GET https://mainnet.historical-staking.provable.com/mainnet/block/0/history/unbonding
//! -> 500
//! Could not load mapping 'unbonding' from block '0' — No such file or directory (os error 2)
//! ```
//!
//! An unknown mapping name is also a 500, with a body listing the valid names. The root path and
//! unfilled placeholders are an empty 404. There is one instance per network
//! (`https://{network}.historical-staking.provable.com`); mainnet and testnet resolve, canary does
//! not.
//!
//! Sizes at mainnet block 1,000,000: `unbonding` 437 B, `stakingrewards` 24 KB, `bonded` 31 KB,
//! answered in 0.1-0.3 s. The whole mapping is fetched to answer a single key, so snapshots are
//! cached by height and every concurrent request for one height shares one fetch.
//!
//! # What this mode serves
//!
//! - `GET /program/credits.aleo/mapping/{name}/{key}/history/{height}` and the `?keys=` batch form,
//!   for the five mappings above. The response body is the value string from the snapshot, or
//!   `null` if the key is absent -- the same body the removed feature produced. Any other program
//!   or mapping is a 404 saying what is supported.
//! - `GET /staking/rewards/{address}/{height}`: `[validator, reward, new_stake]`, as the removed
//!   feature produced it, joined from `stakingrewards` and `bonded` at that height.
//! - `POST /program/{id}/view/{function}/{height}`: a 404 explaining that it cannot be served.
//!
//! The handlers are in `routes.rs`; this module is the upstream client and its cache.
